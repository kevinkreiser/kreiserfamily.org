# Kreiser Family Tree

Welcome to the Kreiser family tree. This site is a work in progress and something I do in my spare time (what little there is). The original work here is mostly that of Clifford Lloyd Kreiser, William Deimler and Sylvia Alverta Schultz Goho. What I've done is taken their work and formatted it such that it can be more easily explored via digital means.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

 * Additions and corrections
 * Searchability (names, dates, places) fuzzy matching
 * Display and navigation of the tree
   * Relationship diagrams or common lineage
   * Expand and collapse branches of the tree
 * Export in standard formats
